commit: 842df63f637c53873d2089964e4fdf33a13cce7a
branch: 0.20.latest
version: 0.20.0

### Fixes

- Avoid slowdown in column-level `persist_docs` on Snowflake, while preserving the error-avoidance from [#3149](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3149) ([#3541](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3541), [#3543](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3543))
- Partial parsing: handle already deleted nodes when schema block also deleted ([#3516](http://github.com/fishown-analystics/dbt/issues/3516), [#3522](http://github.com/fishown-analystics/dbt/issues/3522))

### Docs

- Update dbt logo and links ([docs#197](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-docs/issues/197))

### Under the hood

- Add tracking for experimental parser accuracy ([3503](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/pull/3503), [3553](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/pull/3553))
